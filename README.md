# Personal Settings

This repo contains all of the current settings I have throughout varying environments.

To install, simply go to the directory of the environment you want to change/edit, and run
the provided shell script with `sudo` privileges ( don't worry, I promise to do no evil `\o_o/` ).

Anyone is welcomed to use these provided settings and adjust them to their liking.

### Troubleshooting

- How do I run / execute the scripts?

  Open the terminal in the directory of your choice and run the following command

  ```
  sudo ./install.sh
  ```

* I am getting a permission denied error when running the install script!

  The script does not have execution permissions on your device. To provide it permission, run the following command

  ```
  chmod 766 install.sh
  ```

  Afterwards, execute the script and you should be golden.
